  <h1>Malasakit</h1>
  <br>
  <div class="mareq">
    <b>Description:</b><br>
    The Malasakit Centers Act (Republic Act No. 11463) establishes Malasakit Centers as one-stop shops in all Department of Health (DOH) hospitals and the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) across the Philippines. These centers aim to streamline the process of availing medical and financial assistance by housing representatives from key government agencies, including the DOH, Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), in a single location. This setup ensures that indigent and financially incapacitated patients can efficiently access the support they need without the burden of navigating multiple offices. <br>
<br>
The primary objective of Malasakit Centers is to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for patients by providing comprehensive assistance for medical costs not covered by existing health benefits. By consolidating services, these centers embody the Filipino value of "malasakit," or compassion, ensuring that healthcare services are accessible, efficient, and patient-centered.

Individuals requiring blood can request it from any PRC Blood Service Facility by presenting a Blood Request Form issued by their attending physician or hospital, detailing the patient's information, diagnosis, blood type, and the required number of units. PRC also conducts voluntary blood donation drives to maintain an adequate blood supply and support patients undergoing surgeries, treatments, or emergencies. Additionally, PRC offers free or subsidized blood units for indigent patients through its Blood Samaritan Program, which helps cover processing fees. These services ensure that blood is readily available and accessible to those who need it most.<br><br><br>
